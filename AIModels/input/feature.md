# Feature: Unified Notification System

## Overview

As part of our roadmap for Q3, we aim to introduce a **Unified Notification System (UNS)** across all platforms (web, mobile, email, and Slack) to streamline how users receive, manage, and interact with notifications across our product suite.

Currently, each microservice sends out its own notification logic leading to inconsistency, duplication, and poor UX. This feature aims to centralize notification management and make it configurable, scalable, and extendable.

## User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to receive real-time alerts about project activity so that I can respond quickly.
- **As a user**, I want to snooze or mute specific types of notifications.
- **As an admin**, I want to configure global notification templates and rules.
- **As a developer**, I want to publish notification events via a unified API.

---

## Functional Requirements

- [ ] Event-driven architecture using Kafka or Pub/Sub.
- [ ] Notification API with `POST /notify` supporting batching and metadata.
- [ ] Dashboard for users to manage preferences (email, push, Slack, etc.).
- [ ] Global settings for fallback channels.
- [ ] Retry queue for failed deliveries with backoff strategy.
- [ ] Template engine for dynamic message rendering.
- [ ] Audit log for all sent notifications with delivery status.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Latency under 500ms for push notifications.
- SLA of 99.9% uptime.
- GDPR compliant (user opt-out and deletion supported).
- Horizontal scalability for 10M+ daily messages.

---

## Proposed Architecture

- **Producer Services**: Publish events to Kafka with event schema.
- **Notification Processor**: Consumes events, matches user settings, renders templates.
- **Notification Router**: Dispatches messages to external services (e.g. Firebase, Sendgrid, Slack).
- **User Preferences Store**: Fast-access DB (e.g. Redis or DynamoDB).
- **Admin Console**: Configures templates, categories, and thresholds.

---

## External Services

- Firebase Cloud Messaging (push notifications)
- Sendgrid (email delivery)
- Slack Webhooks (team-based notifications)
- Redis Streams (for real-time preview)
- PostHog (for delivery analytics)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Deliverability Issues**: Use provider-specific analytics and retries.
- **User Overload**: Introduce per-category limits and digest modes.
- **Privacy**: Implement encrypted storage of user channels and permissions.

---

## Milestones

- Week 1–2: Design DB schema and draft templates
- Week 3–4: Implement backend APIs and Kafka consumers
- Week 5–6: Build dashboard and Slack integration
- Week 7: QA, Load Testing, and GDPR audit
- Week 8: Release beta to 10% of users

---

## Success Metrics

- 95% delivery rate across all channels
- <0.5% user opt-out from alerts
- 20% increase in user engagement from targeted alerts
