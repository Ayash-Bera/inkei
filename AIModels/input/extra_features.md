# Client Feedback - v1.2

The login page from version 1.1 works, but we’d like a few upgrades based on internal testing:

- Add "Remember Me" checkbox
- Integrate Google and GitHub OAuth buttons
- Improve error messages (e.g., “Invalid credentials” should be more helpful)
- Support password visibility toggle (show/hide icon)

Additionally, we now need:

- A “Forgot Password?” flow
- A basic user registration (Sign Up) page

Please break these down into subtasks and adjust story points based on the fact that the login page was already implemented in version 1.1.
