## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Modern product and project management processes are complex, involving numerous tasks from UI/UX design to feature implementation and coordination among team members. There's a need to streamline and automate these processes within the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC), making project management more efficient and fluid.

Develop an AI-powered Work Operating System as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that provides a common workspace for client company employees. The innovative features of the solution include:

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Zenith is a SaaS platform that intelligently integrates team collaboration, code
analysis, and sprint planning with real-time AI support. </br>

### Core Features:

‚Ä¢ GitHub Bot: Automatically reviews PRs, detects issues, and suggests optimal fixes or alternatives. </br>
‚Ä¢ Real-Time Chat Interface: Role-based, secure messaging embedded within the workspace. </br>
‚Ä¢ AI Dashboard: Upload documents or files to extract task context, assign story points, and auto-plan sprints. </br>
‚Ä¢ Delta Branch Detection: Identifies branch deviations and reassigns story points accordingly. </br>
‚Ä¢ AI Canvas: Breaks high-level tasks into subtasks with estimated durations.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
NodeJS - ver. 22.0+
Python - ver. 3.x
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

First, copy paste this command into any folder (preferably blank):

```
git clone https://github.com/MashyBasker/inkei.git
```

Then, you need to create a .env file inside your folder where you have cloned the repository. It will contain GEMINI_API_KEY, MONGO_URI, MONGO_CEO_URI, MONGO_SR_URI, MONGO_JR_URI. </br>
Check .env.exampl for help. </br>

Now copy paste the following code inside your Terminal:

```
npm i
npm run dev
cd backend -> npm start
```

You should see https://locahost:5173/ as your frontend server and MongoDB connected and WebSocket server running messages.
</br> Repeat the steps if anything goes wrong.

Now to test the AI pipeline endpoint:

```
cd AIModels -> cd fuckaround
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
You should see a streamlit server running at localhost:8501
Supported files - .md, .txt, .rtf </br>
